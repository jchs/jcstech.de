# jcstech's Blog

My name is Justus-Constantin Schneider,


jcstech.de is my blog where I document my thoughts on tech-related topics and share valuable tips around Google Workspace. For the past three years, I have been an IT Manager at a large tech company that has grown by more than 5000 employees. 


I completed a three-year education to become an IT specialist in Germany and taught myself programming languages to automate daily tasks and complete tedious manual tasks.


My main focus is on Google Workspace, and I have been managing a tenant with 18k+ users for two years. Many tasks within Google Workspace revolve around changing/updating users, managing and sharing files, and updating settings. A lifesaver in my daily work routine has been [GAM](https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM), specifically [GAMADV-XTD3](https://github.com/taers232c/GAMADV-XTD3/) by [Ross Scroggs](https://github.com/taers232c). This tool makes the efforts of managing Google Workspace tenants a breeze! It is a collection of functions that administrators get executed via a terminal or Google Cloud Console. GAM does bulk work, updating/creating users or groups in seconds.


However, some problems have never been solved or have a simple solution available on GitHub. These problems can be solved/worked around via Google App Script or custom scripts. On my blog, you will find answers to these problems. I hope I can save you from frustration or tedious manual work hours. 


Thank you for stopping by, and enjoy your stay.
